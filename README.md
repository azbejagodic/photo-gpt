# Project Architecture

This project consists of three parts:

1. Node.js + Express Server
2. Mobile PWA (Progressive Web App)
3. Manifest V3 Chrome/Brave Extension

Flow:

Phone → PWA → Local Server → Extension → Clipboard

Uploaded images are stored temporarily in:

data/latest/

Each new upload replaces the previous batch.

# Requirements

- Node.js (18+ recommended)
- npm
- Chrome or Brave (for extension)
- Phone and PC connected to the same Wi-Fi network

# Access From Phone

On Windows:

ipconfig

Look for:

IPv4 Address

# Windows Firewall Configuration (Important)

If your phone cannot connect:

Allow Node.js through firewall:

1. Open Windows Defender Firewall
